#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

The methodical application of engineering concepts, techniques, and instruments to the creation and upkeep of superior software systems is known as software engineering.  It includes software product design, development, testing, deployment, and maintenance.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

The development of programming languages (such as Fortran and C), the discipline of software engineering's establishment in the 1960s, the introduction of structured programming in the 1970s, and the emergence of agile approaches in the 2000s are some of the major innovations and milestones.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

Requirements: Compiling and recording system and user requirements.
   Design: Producing detailed and high-level user interface and software architecture designs.
   Implementation: Writing code and constructing the software in accordance with the design specifications constitutes.

   Testing: Performing a range of tests to make sure the program satisfies functional requirements and quality standards.
   Deployment: Giving users or clients access to the software.
   After the software is deployed, maintenance entails giving it continuing support, upgrades, and improvements.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

Waterfall is best suited for projects with well specified needs, like government or medical software, since it takes a linear, sequential approach in which each phase—requirements, design, implementation, testing, and deployment—must be finished before going on to the next.  On the other hand, Agile is more appropriate for projects with changing needs, like SaaS products or mobile apps, because it is flexible and iterative, enabling constant input and modification.  Agile works well in collaborative, fast-paced settings that need regular updates, whereas Waterfall is excellent for projects that are regimented and heavily documented.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

Software Developer creates software solutions by writing, testing, and maintaining code. 
Quality Assurance (QA) Engineer uses testing and bug finding to guarantee the quality of software.
Project Manager (PM) supervises the development process and controls communication, resources, and schedules.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

IDEs (such as Visual Studio Code and IntelliJ IDEA) simplify coding by providing tools like debuggers and automation.  VCS (e.g., Git, SVN) facilitates cooperation and keeps track of changes.  Both increase development productivity and code management.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

Managing shifting requirements, technical debt, tight timelines, and debugging complicated problems are some of the difficulties faced by software developers.  They may get around issues by using effective debugging tools and techniques, prioritising task management and realistic planning, using clean code practices with frequent refactoring to decrease technological debt, and adhering to Agile methodology for flexibility.  Collaboration and ongoing learning are also beneficial for effectively addressing changing technology and solving problems.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

Unit testing verifies the accuracy of specific parts or functions (e.g., testing a single function in Python).  
Integration testing (e.g., testing API interactions) confirms that merged components function as intended.  
System testing assesses the functioning of the complete program in a real-world setting (e.g., evaluating the performance of a web app).  
Before software is released, acceptance testing (such as client validation tests) makes sure it satisfies user expectations and business needs.  
Every kind is essential for early problem detection, performance enhancement, and guaranteeing a flawless user experience.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

Prompt engineering is the process of creating and improving inputs to maximise AI model replies.  
It entails efficiently constructing queries and directing the model's output with context, restrictions, and explicit instructions.  In activities like data analysis, coding help, and content creation, this is essential for increasing AI's precision, applicability, and efficiency.  Effective prompts increase output, eliminate uncertainty, and guarantee that AI provides insightful and contextually relevant answers.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

Vague Prompt: "Tell me about technology."

Improved Prompt: "Explain how artificial intelligence is transforming healthcare, with examples of its applications in diagnostics and treatment."

The revised prompt is clear, specifying artificial intelligence rather than broad "technology." It is specific, focusing on AI's impact in healthcare. It is also concise, directing the AI to provide examples in diagnostics and treatment, ensuring a more relevant and informative response.
